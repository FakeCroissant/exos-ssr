Directories:
- OnLineExos - the solutions of the authors
- Unsolved - the same files with automatically stripped solutions / proofs
- Catalin - my solutions, comments, and notes

The solutions are known to work with Coq 8.3pl4 and SSReflect 1.3.
They don't work with the latest variants of Coq and SSReflect,
but shouldn't be too hard to port.
